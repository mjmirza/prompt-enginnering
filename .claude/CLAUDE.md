# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a comprehensive knowledge base for prompt engineering, capturing personal experience, techniques, patterns, and best practices. It is designed to be a living document that grows with accumulated expertise in crafting effective prompts for AI systems.

## Repository Structure

This is a documentation-focused repository organized to cover all aspects of prompt engineering:

- **Fundamentals**: Core concepts, principles, and terminology of prompt engineering
- **Techniques**: Specific prompting strategies and methods (e.g., chain-of-thought, few-shot learning, role-based prompting)
- **Patterns**: Reusable prompt templates and structures for common use cases
- **Examples**: Real-world examples with analysis of what works and why
- **Case Studies**: Detailed explorations of complex prompting scenarios
- **Best Practices**: Guidelines, dos and don'ts, and lessons learned
- **Tools & Resources**: References to prompt engineering tools, frameworks, and resources
- **Research Notes**: Observations, experiments, and findings from personal experience

## Content Development Workflow

When adding new content to this repository:

1. **Documentation Format**: Use Markdown (.md) files for all documentation
2. **Organization**: Keep content modular and well-categorized by topic
3. **Cross-referencing**: Link related concepts across different documents
4. **Examples**: Always include practical examples with explanations
5. **Versioning**: Document when techniques evolve or change based on new learnings

## File Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens for file names (e.g., `chain-of-thought.md`)
- Prefix numbered sequences when order matters (e.g., `01-basics.md`, `02-intermediate.md`)
- Use descriptive names that reflect content clearly

## Content Guidelines

- Focus on practical, tested techniques over theoretical concepts
- Include both successful and unsuccessful examples to show contrast
- Document the "why" behind techniques, not just the "how"
- Keep examples concise but complete enough to be reproducible
- Update content as understanding evolves

## Repository Goals

This repository aims to be:
- A personal reference guide for prompt engineering
- A structured knowledge base that grows over time
- A resource for understanding what works in different contexts
- A record of learning journey and evolving best practices
