## Template Structure

Each pattern template includes:
- **Purpose**: What the pattern accomplishes
- **When to Use**: Appropriate scenarios
- **Template**: The reusable prompt structure
- **Variables**: Customizable elements
- **Examples**: Filled-in templates
- **Variations**: Alternative approaches
- **Tips**: Optimization suggestions

## Using Templates

1. Select a pattern matching your use case
2. Replace variables with specific content
3. Adjust parameters as needed
4. Test and iterate
5. Save successful variations

## Template Best Practices

- Keep templates flexible and adaptable
- Include clear placeholders for variables
- Document expected outputs
- Provide both simple and complex examples
- Version templates as they evolve
