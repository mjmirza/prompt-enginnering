```

### Trend Analysis
```
Analyze trends in this time-series data:

[TIME-SERIES DATA]

Identify:
1. Overall trend direction (increasing/decreasing/stable)
2. Seasonal patterns
3. Significant inflection points
4. Rate of change
5. Forecast for next [period]

Explain what's driving these trends.
```

### Root Cause Analysis
```
This metric has [changed/dropped/increased]:

Current value: [X]
Previous value: [Y]
Change: [Z]

Supporting data:
[RELATED METRICS/CONTEXT]

Perform root cause analysis:
1. List potential causes (ranked by likelihood)
2. Supporting evidence for each
3. Most probable explanation
4. Recommended investigation steps
5. Suggested corrective actions
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Website Analytics
```
Analyze this website traffic data from the past 3 months:

Monthly visitors:
- Month 1: 45,000 (Bounce rate: 58%, Avg session: 2:30)
- Month 2: 52,000 (Bounce rate: 62%, Avg session: 2:15)
- Month 3: 48,000 (Bounce rate: 55%, Avg session: 2:45)

Top traffic sources:
- Organic search: 60%
- Direct: 20%
- Social media: 15%
- Referrals: 5%

Top landing pages:
1. Homepage (40% of traffic, 65% bounce rate)
2. Blog article "How to X" (25% of traffic, 45% bounce rate)
3. Product page (20% of traffic, 50% bounce rate)

Analysis Framework:
1. Traffic trends and patterns
2. Engagement quality indicators
3. Source effectiveness
4. Landing page performance
5. Key insights and anomalies
6. Actionable recommendations to improve metrics

Provide analysis in clear sections with specific recommendations.
```

### Example 2: Customer Survey Results
```
Interpret these customer satisfaction survey results (n=500):

Overall satisfaction: 7.2/10 (down from 7.8 last quarter)

Category breakdown:
- Product quality: 8.5/10
- Customer service: 6.2/10
- Value for money: 7.0/10
- User experience: 6.8/10
- Delivery speed: 7.5/10

Open-ended feedback themes (by frequency):
1. "Slow customer service response" (mentioned by 35%)
2. "Great product quality" (mentioned by 42%)
3. "Website is confusing" (mentioned by 28%)
4. "Shipping costs too high" (mentioned by 22%)

Analysis needed:
1. Identify the main driver of overall satisfaction decline
2. Correlate quantitative scores with qualitative feedback
3. Prioritize areas for improvement
4. Recommend specific actions
5. Predict impact of addressing top issues

Context: E-commerce company, competitive market
```

### Example 3: A/B Test Results
```
Evaluate this A/B test and recommend a decision:

Test: Email subject line variations
Sample size: 10,000 per variant
Duration: 7 days

Variant A (Control): "New arrivals this week"
- Open rate: 18.5%
- Click-through rate: 2.8%
- Conversion rate: 0.45%
- Revenue per email: $0.34

Variant B: "Your personalized picks are here"
- Open rate: 22.3%
- Click-through rate: 3.4%
- Conversion rate: 0.52%
- Revenue per email: $0.41

Statistical significance: 95% confidence level

Analyze:
1. Which variant won and by how much
2. Statistical validity of results
3. Business impact (revenue lift)
4. Should we implement the winner?
5. Any surprising insights
6. Recommendations for future tests
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Context**: Understand what the data represents
2. **Look for Patterns**: Identify trends before diving into details
3. **Question Anomalies**: Investigate outliers and unexpected results
4. **Correlate Metrics**: Look for relationships between data points
5. **Be Objective**: Let data drive conclusions, not assumptions
6. **Consider Limitations**: Acknowledge data quality issues
7. **Provide Context**: Compare to benchmarks or historical data
8. **Make it Actionable**: Translate insights into recommendations

## Common Pitfalls

- Cherry-picking data that supports preconceived notions
- Confusing correlation with causation
- Ignoring sample size and statistical significance
- Not considering external factors or context
- Over-interpreting minor fluctuations
- Presenting data without clear insights
- Using jargon without explanation
- Missing the "so what?" - implications

## Tips for Optimization

- Specify the decision or question the analysis should inform
- Provide relevant context and benchmarks
- Request specific visualizations or comparison formats
- Ask for both quantitative and qualitative interpretation
- Request confidence levels or caveats
- Specify the audience for the analysis (technical vs. non-technical)
- Ask for prioritized recommendations
- Request alternative explanations for patterns

## Combining with Other Techniques

- **Data Interpretation + Visualization**: Request chart/graph descriptions
- **Data Interpretation + Storytelling**: Frame insights as narrative
- **Data Interpretation + Decision-Making**: Connect analysis to specific decisions
- **Data Interpretation + Prediction**: Forecast based on trends
- **Data Interpretation + Action Planning**: Transform insights into action items
