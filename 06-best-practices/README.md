# Best Practices and Guidelines

This directory contains guidelines, dos and don'ts, and lessons learned from practical experience.

## Core Principles

### Clarity and Specificity
- Be explicit about what you want
- Avoid ambiguous language
- Provide clear constraints
- Specify output format
- Define success criteria

### Context Management
- Provide necessary background
- Don't assume prior knowledge
- Include relevant details
- Remove unnecessary information
- Structure context logically

### Instruction Design
- Use clear, actionable language
- Break complex tasks into steps
- Prioritize instructions
- Use consistent terminology
- Test instruction clarity

### Iteration and Refinement
- Start simple, then refine
- Test multiple variations
- Learn from failures
- Document what works
- Continuously improve

## Common Pitfalls

### What NOT to Do
- Vague or overly broad prompts
- Too many instructions at once
- Inconsistent formatting in examples
- Assuming model knowledge
- Ignoring context limits
- Over-constraining creativity
- Under-specifying technical tasks

### Common Mistakes
- Not testing edge cases
- Forgetting to specify output format
- Mixing multiple intents
- Unclear success criteria
- Insufficient examples
- Over-reliance on a single approach
- Ignoring model limitations

## Optimization Strategies

### Token Efficiency
- Concise but complete prompts
- Remove redundant information
- Use abbreviations when appropriate
- Structure data efficiently
- Prioritize critical context

### Quality Improvement
- Use examples for complex tasks
- Add reasoning steps
- Request self-verification
- Specify quality criteria
- Include format specifications

### Consistency
- Maintain consistent structure
- Use standardized templates
- Document successful patterns
- Version control prompts
- Share learnings

## Testing and Validation

### Prompt Testing
- Test with edge cases
- Verify output format
- Check consistency across runs
- Validate against requirements
- Compare alternative approaches

### Quality Assurance
- Define success metrics
- Review outputs critically
- Test with various inputs
- Document failure modes
- Establish baselines

## Dos and Don'ts

### Do:
- Start with clear objectives
- Provide examples for complex tasks
- Specify output format
- Test and iterate
- Document what works
- Consider token usage
- Think about edge cases
- Use appropriate techniques
- Adapt to model strengths
- Learn from failures

### Don't:
- Make prompts unnecessarily complex
- Assume model capabilities
- Ignore context limitations
- Use ambiguous instructions
- Forget to specify constraints
- Over-optimize prematurely
- Rely on single approach
- Ignore model feedback
- Skip testing
- Forget documentation

## Domain-Specific Guidelines

### Technical Tasks
- Be precise with terminology
- Specify versions and dependencies
- Include error handling requirements
- Define output format strictly
- Consider edge cases

### Creative Tasks
- Allow flexibility in approach
- Provide inspiration and direction
- Set boundaries without over-constraining
- Encourage exploration
- Value uniqueness

### Analytical Tasks
- Request step-by-step reasoning
- Specify analytical framework
- Define metrics and criteria
- Request evidence-based conclusions
- Encourage comprehensive analysis

## Continuous Improvement

- Maintain a prompt library
