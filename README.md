## Getting Started

1. Start with `/01-fundamentals/` to understand core concepts
2. Explore `/02-techniques/` for specific prompting strategies
3. Use `/03-patterns/` as templates for common tasks
4. Review `/04-examples/` for real-world applications
5. Reference `/06-best-practices/` for optimization tips

## Contributing to This Repository

This is a personal knowledge base that documents:
- Techniques that work well in practice
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
- Lessons learned from experimentation
- Evolving understanding of prompt engineering

New content should include:
- Clear explanations with examples
- Both successful and unsuccessful attempts
- Context about when and why techniques work
- Cross-references to related concepts

## Goals

- Build a comprehensive, practical guide to prompt engineering
- Document personal growth and learning journey
- Create reusable patterns and templates
- Share insights and best practices
- Continuously improve based on experience
