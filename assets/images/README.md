## Adding New Images

When adding new images:

1. Choose the appropriate subdirectory (or create a new one if needed)
2. Use descriptive, lowercase file names with hyphens (e.g., `chain-of-thought-example-01.png`)
3. Include the date in the filename if the content is time-sensitive
4. Consider adding a companion `.md` file to provide context, description, or attribution
5. Optimize image sizes for web viewing when possible
